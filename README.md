## Project Description:

Multedio is our ambitious project aimed at creating a feature-rich Lightroom duplicate. Leveraging GTK and OpenCV libraries in C, we intend to enhance the user experience with advanced features such as presets, brightness adjustments, opacity changes, grayscale transformations, and more. The Figma-designed user interface (UI) will be seamlessly implemented using GTK, providing a visually appealing and intuitive platform for image editing. Our project delves into key operating system (OS) concepts, including multiprocessing, interprocess communication (IPC), multithreading, and other relevant aspects.

## Project Imaginary:

### Take a sneak peek at our project's introductory base:
![](https://github.com/completelyblank/Multedio/blob/main/src/Multedio_Open.gif)
### List of Components:

1. **User Interface Design (Figma):**
   - Wireframe main interface components and design user-friendly UI elements for presets, brightness, opacity, grayscale, etc.
   - Utilize a carefully chosen color scheme to enhance the user experience.
   - Implement intuitive icons for visual recognition.
   - Explore responsive design principles for adaptability to various screen sizes.

2. **Implementation (GTK/OpenCV in C):**
   - Set up project structure for easy navigation.
   - Develop basic UI components using GTK.
   - Integrate OpenCV for image processing.
   - Integrate a Formula using GTK and direct porportion to resize to different Screen Sizes
   - Implement robust error handling and memory management.

3. **Features:**
   - Brightness adjustments
   - Contrast modifications
   - Color manipulation
   - Cropping & rotation
   - Noise reduction
   - Sharpening
   - Revert to original & Go to latest
   - Presets

4. **Operating System Concepts (Simplified):**
   - Explore multiprocessing techniques.
   - Implement inter-process communication.
   - Integrate basic multithreading for concurrent tasks.
   - Address OS-specific error handling.

5. **Testing:**
   - Conduct unit tests for each feature.
   - Perform integration testing for seamless functionality.
   - Ensure compatibility across different operating systems.
   - Implement stress testing for performance evaluation.

6. **Documentation:**
   - Provide clear documentation for UI/UX design decisions, implementation details, and code structure.
   - Develop beginner-friendly user manuals and guides for Multedio.
   - Include troubleshooting tips for common user issues.

### How to Run (Linux):

1. Open a terminal.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install GTK and OpenCV libraries for Linux (Commands may vary based on the Linux distribution).
4. Run the makefile using the command: `make`.
5. Execute the object file using the command: `./test.o`.
6. Explore Multedio!

### How to Run (Windows):
*(To be determined)*

### Future Enhancements (Optional):
- Explore additional image processing features.
- Consider local storage integration.
- Investigate AI-based image enhancement algorithms.
- Add localization support for multiple languages.
- Evaluate keyboard shortcuts for power users.
