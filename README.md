## Project Description:

Multedio is our ambitious project aimed at creating a feature-rich Lightroom duplicate. Leveraging GTK and OpenCV libraries in C, we intend to enhance the user experience with advanced features such as presets, brightness adjustments, opacity changes, grayscale transformations, and more. The Figma-designed user interface (UI) will be seamlessly implemented using GTK, providing a visually appealing and intuitive platform for image editing. Our project delves into key operating system (OS) concepts, including multiprocessing, interprocess communication (IPC), multithreading, and other relevant aspects.

## Project Imaginary:

### Take a sneak peek at our project's introductory base:

## List:

### User Interface Design (Figma):

We aim to wireframe the main interface components and design user-friendly UI elements for presets, brightness, opacity, grayscale, etc. A carefully chosen color scheme enhances the user experience, while intuitive icons aid visual recognition. Additionally, we may explore responsive design principles for adaptability to various screen sizes.

### Implementation (GTK/OpenCV in C):

Our project structure is set up for easy navigation, and basic UI components using GTK are underway. The integration of OpenCV for image processing, along with robust error handling and memory management, is a priority to ensure a stable application.

### Features:

Presets for quick edits, brightness and opacity controls, and grayscale filter options have been implemented. Future tasks include exploring contrast adjustment, undo/redo functionality, and potentially adding tooltips for user guidance.

### Operating System Concepts (Simplified):

We plan to explore multiprocessing techniques, implement inter-process communication, and integrate basic multithreading for concurrent tasks. Additionally, we will investigate and address OS-specific error handling.

### Testing:

A comprehensive testing phase involves conducting unit tests for each feature, performing integration testing for seamless functionality, ensuring compatibility across different operating systems, and implementing stress testing for performance evaluation.

### Documentation:

Clear documentation for UI/UX design decisions, implementation details, and code structure is essential. We'll develop beginner-friendly user manuals and guides for Multedio, including troubleshooting tips for common user issues.

### How to run (Linux):
*) Go to terrminal
*) cd to Project Directory
*) Install GTK and openCV libraries for Linux (Commands may vary on type of OS)
*) Run make file using the command: "make"
*) Run the Object File using the commands: ./test.o
*) Check it Out!

### How to run (Windows):

### Future Enhancements (Optional):

Exploration of additional image processing features, consideration for local storage integration, investigation into AI-based image enhancement algorithms, localization support for multiple languages, and evaluation of keyboard shortcuts for power users are optional enhancements for the future.

This readme file serves as a roadmap for the Multedio project, highlighting our goals, progress, and future plans. Regular collaboration and feedback sessions will play a crucial role in the successful development of this innovative Lightroom duplicate.
